GENERAL TODOS:
- [ ]  viewports for mobile vs desktop
- [ ]  buttons on login and register pages are too close together
- [ ]  unit testing - end-to-end testing - smoke testing
- [ ]  user shouldn't be able to log in with Google without having an account already registered
- [ ]  can use vs code copilot/ chatgpt to make tests
- [ ]  clicking on a map image gives popup/page with relevant colour tags and ratings
- [ ]  map center should change based on proximity decided on by the user

TODAY'S TODOS:
- [ ]  test on android too
- [ ]  remove option to take photo directly within the app
- [ ]  make map page taller when submitted photo


- [ ]  might have to implement the following workflow --> user opens first time, we get all of the images near them
--> save the images or something to local storage to access later?
--> could add to the database the list of current folder names so could make it faster for fetching?

- [ ]  might have to add the nearby images to the db and then add a refresh location button somewhere
- [ ]  option for map view is to load only the locations of the images and when clicking on the location you get the image and i perform a fetch for the image


- [ ]  change files to typescript and change file names
- [ ]  might have to add in a db wipe for submitting the application if I cant get the server to work


based on time add in graphs showing how close a colour is to another one etc
