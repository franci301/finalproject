GENERAL TODOS:
- [ ]  viewports for mobile vs desktop
- [ ]  buttons on login and register pages are too close together
- [ ]  unit testing - end-to-end testing - smoke testing
- [ ]  user shouldn't be able to log in with Google without having an account already registered
- [ ]  can use vs code copilot/ chatgpt to make tests
- [ ]  clicking on a map image gives popup/page with relevant colour tags and ratings
- [ ]  map center should change based on proximity decided on by the user

TODAY'S TODOS:
- [ ]  ADD IN A WARNING THAT THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU GO TO CAMERA > FORMATS > MOST COMPATIBLE
- [ ]  test on android too
- [ ]  remove option to take photo directly within the app
- [ ]  make map page taller when submitted photo
- [ ]  add in error checks for empty postcode --> add condition to load map being that postcode is false and set initial postcode to true
- [ ]  before I show the search results I have to calculate the nearest images to the user
- [ ]  ask for location permissions on app

- [ ] Show images on homepage

- [ ]  might have to implement the following workflow --> user opens first time, we get all of the images near them
--> save the images or something to local storage to access later?
--> could add to the database the list of current folder names so could make it faster for fetching?

- [ ]  might have to add the nearby images to the db and then add a refresh location button somewhere
