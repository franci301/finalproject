# Reverie - a digital imagery map application

Reverie aims to allow users to search for images based on the colours found inside of them


# Installation

- Prerequisites:
  - Node v19.8.1 
  - npm v8.3.0 
- cd into 'finalproject'
```bash
$ npm install
```

# Usage

```bash
$ npm start
```

# Note
As I couldn't set up the Oracle cloud server, you may see some 'error could not fetch image' in the console .
Do not worry about this as it doesn't cause the application to crash.
The only downside of this is that you cannot search for images when testing the application.
Unfortunately this is out of my control.

You can however, upload some images and then search for these to test the search features.
