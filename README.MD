# Reverie - a digital imagery map application

Reverie aims to allow users to search for images based on the colours found inside of them


# Installation

- Prerequisites:
  - Node v19.8.1 
  - npm v8.3.0 
  - I reccomend installing pycharm so the below commands work in the read me file
- cd into 'finalproject'
```bash
# Install required packages
$ npm install
```

# Usage

```bash
# run the application on port 3000
$ npm start
```

# Running the commands in the terminal
first run 'npm install'
then run 'npm start'

# Note
As I couldn't set up the Oracle cloud server, you may see some 'error could not fetch image' in the console .
Do not worry about this as it doesn't cause the application to crash.
The only downside of this is that you cannot search for images when testing the application.
Unfortunately this is out of my control.
You can however, upload some images and then search for these to test the search features.
This happens as i have uploaded some images when recording for the final video which havent been sent over with this code.
# Bugs
I am aware of one bug which causes the application to crash when submitting an image
This doesnt occur for every images and infact it has only happened to one image
I believe it is because the image takes too long to load into the browser.
If you encounter this bug please use a different image
