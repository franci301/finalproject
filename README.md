# THE APPLICATION IS NOT IN A FINISHED STATE SO YOU MAY ENCOCUNTER BUGS

## How To View

The application is meant to be a mobile based web application so when viewing this app, either resize your browser or click inspect --> Toggle device toolbar (so that it is hilighted in blue) and then select a phone of your choosing ( i like the iphone 12)

As i havent made the media queries yet, it is best to view this on chrome due to the better developer tools available.

# Social Media enabled photogenic location finder

The basis of the app is to allow users to submit photos to the application, which will generate a colour palette of the image which will allow other users to search for the image based off of the colour palette.

I am developing this application as part of my final year project for my undergraduate Computer Science degree.

The application also extracts the location from which the photo was taken and shows it to the user on the map.
All this information will be uploaded to the database where a user can then query the app and be shown the location of the image.

## Current Missing Components for live testing

The server is still local so the user will not be able to see any pictures they upload in their profile page.
Searching the application is currently not live.
