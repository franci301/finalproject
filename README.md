# THE APPLICATION IS NOT IN A FINISHED STATE SO YOU MAY ENCOCUNTER BUGS

# Social Media enabled photogenic location finder

The basis of the app is to allow users to submit photos to the application, which will generate a colour palette of the image which will allow other users to search for the image based off of the colour palette.

I am developing this application as part of my final year project for my undergraduate Computer Science degree.

The application also extracts the location from which the photo was taken and shows it to the user on the map.
All this information will be uploaded to the database where a user can then query the app and be shown the location of the image.

## Current Missing Components for live testing

The server is still local so the user will not be able to see any pictures they upload in their profile page.
Searching the application is currently not live.
